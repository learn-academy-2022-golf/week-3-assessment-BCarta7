# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a tool that allows you to use javascript and html elements in the same code. To use javascript functionality in JSX, you need to wrap it in curly braces.

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension of Javascript designed to build components in React. It allows a combination of HTML tags and javascript functionality.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: yarn is a tool used from the terminal to install and run React apps. It can install the various modules, .lock and .json file associated with React.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager for React that fetches and downloads dependencies for creating a React app. 

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: An anonymous function is an unnamed function, as in it is not directly attached to a variable. I believe, for example, the functions inside higher order functions would be considered anonymous.

Researched answer: Anonymous functions are not named, and cannot be accessed again after their creation unless invoked through a parent function.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State is data saved locally through user input, props are bits of data made available across React components through props syntax.

Researched answer: State is data saved locally TO IT'S COMPONENT only, whereas props pass data between components.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for document object model. I'm not yet sure on the technicalities of it, but I believe it represents the UI as a user would while interacting with it. 

Researched answer: The DOM is a representation of a created web page that can be displayed in the browser during development.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: I know a div is used to "lump" together elements in html and jsx as a single customizable element. I'm not sure when it comes to span, but will research it and can get a better answer back to you.

Researched answer: They are similar in their use for grouping elements together for common styling and use, but span is an inline element.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: A style of programming that is organized around objects and data over functions.

2. Ruby: an object-oriented general purpose programming language designed for easy user accessability.

3. Implicit return: The final value of a function is returned without having to use the return keyword.

4. Ruby blocks: anonymous functions used in methods through key words or curly braces

5. Ruby hashes: an array-like collection of key-value pairs that are accessed through the keys rather than index values.
